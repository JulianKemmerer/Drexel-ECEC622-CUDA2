To build:

Do a "make clean" followed by a "make".  Ensure the makefile is in the directory.

To run:

Navigate through the main bin folder in CUDA_SDK/C/bin and run "./vector_dot_product <num_elements>".  Although the lab says the number of elements was guaranteed to be 100 millio, the skeleton code given had the parameter, so we left it.
